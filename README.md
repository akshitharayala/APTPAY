**AptPay Smart Contract — Escrow-Based Payment on Aptos**

The AptPay Smart Contract is a blockchain-based escrow payment solution built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move language.
It enables secure, transparent, and automated transactions between clients and freelancers, ensuring that payments are only released once work is completed or mutually agreed upon.

🔐 Smart Contract Guarantees

Secure Payments — Client funds are locked on-chain until milestones are met.

Fair Transactions — Neither party can cheat; rules are enforced by immutable code.

Automation — Funds can be released automatically after a set time or upon client approval.

✨ Features

Automatic Fund Release — Auto-releases funds after a set time if the client is unresponsive.

Role-Based Actions — Only the client can create a contract and approve milestones; only the freelancer can accept.
